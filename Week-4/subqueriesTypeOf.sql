select * from orders

--1. Scalar Subquery
--Definition:
--A subquery that returns exactly one value (one row, one column).
--It can be used in SELECT, WHERE, or HAVING clauses.

--Find the customer who placed the highest order:

SELECT CustomerName 
FROM Orders 
WHERE OrderAmount = (
 SELECT MAX(OrderAmount) FROM Orders
)

-- Find customers whose order amount is equal to the second highest order placed.


SELECT *
FROM Orders
WHERE OrderAmount = (
    SELECT MAX(OrderAmount)
    FROM Orders
    WHERE OrderAmount < (
        SELECT MAX(OrderAmount) FROM Orders
    )
);


--2. Multi-Row Subquery
--Definition:
--Returns multiple rows. Used with operators like IN, ANY, or ALL.

--Find orders placed in cities where any order was greater than 100:

SELECT *
FROM Orders
WHERE City IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT City
    FROM Orders
    WHERE OrderAmount > 100
);



SELECT *
FROM Orders
WHERE City IN (
    SELECT City
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY City
    HAVING MIN(OrderAmount) >= 100
);

--Find customers who live in cities where no one ordered below â‚¹100.


--3. Correlated Subquery
--Definition:
--A subquery that depends on the outer query. It's executed once per outer row.

--Get orders where the order amount is above average for that customer's city:

SELECT *
FROM Orders O1
WHERE OrderAmount > (
    SELECT AVG(OrderAmount)
    FROM Orders O2
    WHERE O2.City = O1.City
);

--Find customers who placed the maximum order in their city.

SELECT *
FROM Orders O1
WHERE OrderAmount = (
    SELECT MAX(OrderAmount)
    FROM Orders O2
    WHERE O2.City = O1.City
);



--4. Nested Subquery
--Definition:
--A subquery inside another subquery. Layers of logic.

--Find the max order amount using a double subquery:

SELECT *
FROM Orders
WHERE OrderAmount = (
    SELECT MAX(OrderAmount)
    FROM (
        SELECT OrderAmount FROM Orders
    ) AS Sub
);

--Find orders whose amount is above the average of all orders placed in Delhi.

SELECT *
FROM Orders
WHERE OrderAmount > (
    SELECT AVG(OrderAmount)
    FROM (
        SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE City = 'Delhi'
    ) AS DelhiOrders
);

--5. Inline View (FROM Clause Subquery)
--Definition:
--A subquery used as a temporary table in the FROM clause.

--Count high-value orders per city:

SELECT City, COUNT(*) AS HighOrderCount
FROM (
    SELECT * FROM Orders
    WHERE OrderAmount > 100
) AS HighOrders
GROUP BY City;

--Find the total number of orders per city, but only for customers whose order amount is odd 

SELECT City, COUNT(*) AS OddOrderCount
FROM (
    SELECT * FROM Orders
    WHERE OrderAmount % 2 = 1
) AS OddOrders
GROUP BY City;

--6. Subquery in SELECT Clause
--Definition:
--Subquery used to add a calculated column per row.

--Show average order amount of each customer's city:

SELECT 
    OrderID,
    CustomerName,
    City,
    OrderAmount,
    (SELECT AVG(OrderAmount) 
     FROM Orders AS O2 
     WHERE O2.City = O1.City) AS CityAvgOrder
FROM Orders AS O1;




SELECT 
    OrderID,
    CustomerName,
    City,
    OrderAmount,
    OrderAmount - (
        SELECT AVG(OrderAmount)
        FROM Orders AS O2
        WHERE O2.City = O1.City
    ) AS DiffFromCityAvg
FROM Orders AS O1




--List all orders and show how much each order is above or below the average order amount in that city.
